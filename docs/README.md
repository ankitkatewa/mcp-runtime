# MCP Runtime

MCP Runtime is an open source, Kubernetes-native control plane for deploying, governing, and brokering MCP servers. It packages server deployment, registry workflows, gateway routing, access policy, audit evidence, and observability into one operating surface for platform, security, and compliance teams.

Unlike public MCP directories or client-specific catalogs, MCP Runtime is not
just a place to discover servers. The UI is the front door to a deployable
platform: internal server catalog, Kubernetes reconciliation, registry workflow,
brokered tool calls, access grants, consented sessions, audit, and operational
visibility. The hosted platform shows what that experience looks like; companies
can run the same model inside their own clusters.

## What MCP Runtime installs

`mcp-runtime setup` installs the CRDs, runtime namespaces, an operator, registry
integration, ingress wiring, and the bundled Sentinel stack. Sentinel includes
the gateway request path, grant/session policy materialization, analytics
ingest and processing, dashboard/API services, and observability components.

## Compared with MCP directories

Top MCP directories and catalogs such as Glama, Smithery, Docker MCP Catalog,
PulseMCP, mcp.so, and client-specific catalogs are useful for public discovery,
metadata, install snippets, or client onboarding. MCP Runtime is different: it
is an open source control plane for operating governed MCP servers inside a
company environment.

| Others usually provide | MCP Runtime provides |
|---|---|
| Public discovery and categories | Internal server catalog plus deployable runtime |
| Install snippets and connection docs | Kubernetes `MCPServer` reconciliation and routes |
| Popularity or metadata signals | Trust, grants, sessions, policy decisions, and audit |
| Hosted directory or client-specific UX | Self-hosted, vendor-neutral Kubernetes control plane |

We have not found another open source MCP product that combines server
discovery with the deployable Kubernetes operator, registry workflow, brokered
request path, access/session model, and audit pipeline in one system.

## Governance, audit, and compliance

MCP Runtime keeps governance on the live request path instead of leaving it as
out-of-band documentation. The gateway evaluates `MCPAccessGrant` and
`MCPAgentSession` policy before tool calls reach a server, including tool-level
allow/deny rules, trust requirements, consented trust, expiry, and revocation.

Each decision can emit audit and analytics events with the server, namespace,
human ID, agent ID, session ID, tool name, policy version, decision, reason, and
trust context. That gives platform and security teams a queryable record for
reviewing access, investigating denied calls, and preparing compliance evidence
for governed agent workflows.

## Before setup

MCP Runtime expects an already-running Kubernetes cluster and a workstation with
the CLI prerequisites installed. The setup flow applies the runtime manifests,
installs the operator and Sentinel services, and wires ingress and registry
resources for the selected environment.

For provider-specific prerequisites such as container runtime registry trust,
DNS, ingress, TLS, and k3s configuration, start with
[Cluster readiness](cluster-readiness.md).

## Common workflows

| Workflow | Start here |
|---|---|
| Evaluate MCP Runtime for a private MCP platform | [Getting started](getting-started.md), then [Architecture](architecture.md) |
| Run MCP Runtime on a real cluster | [Cluster readiness](cluster-readiness.md), then [Runtime](runtime.md) |
| Govern tools and sessions | [Sentinel](sentinel.md), then [API reference](api.md) |
| Integrate from automation | [CLI](cli.md), then [API reference](api.md) |
| Work on the codebase | [Internals](internals/README.md) |

## Project status

MCP Runtime is alpha. The architecture is stable enough to evaluate as governed MCP infrastructure, but API and UX details are still evolving. Treat the `v1alpha1` types as the source of truth.
